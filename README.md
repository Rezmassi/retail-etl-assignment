Retail ETL

This project implements an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline for a retail dataset. It includes SQL queries to extract customer and product insights from a PostgreSQL database, Python scripts to transform and format data, and a Git workflow for version control. The pipeline produces CSV outputs for top customers, order counts, and unsold products.
